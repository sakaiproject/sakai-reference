# S2U Conversion Scripts
This folder contains the conversion scripts for the S2U Unidigital project, more information can be found here https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/S2U

Please add one script for each Jira that requires a conversion script, using the same Jira code.

The folder has been created to track conversion scripts for the S2U features in order to receive community feedback and facilitate the contribution process.

## Important
DO NOT apply these scripts to your Sakai instance by any mean unless you know what you are doing, the S2U features might not be present in the Sakai community version so this scripts can break your instance.

## Contribution

After contributing an S2U ticket to Sakai Master (S2U to SAK), please remove the script from this folder.
